## Build process

When bulding the frontend the first thing we did was create the login page with the pop ups for each form. We then moved on to creating the basic layout and css for each of the individual pages. After we had the structure of the pages we went back and including the links between pages to ensure you could easily navigate around the website. Following on from this we started to connect the frontend to the backend via fetch requests to the available routes in the backend.

## Wins & Challenges

### Wins

* Getting the website deployed early.
* Getting the website functional early.
* The look of the login page
* The look of the scroll bar

## Challenges

* communicating what backend routes were required and what needed to be passed through.
* Having one less person meant having to work later than usual
* Frontend testing is very problematic due to most of the functions refering to DOM elements.


## Future Features

* Habit badges updating styling at streak milestones
* Tracking more habits
* Logout function
